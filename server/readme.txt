Note:
=======
- Don't forget to change the upload url in app.coffee
- I'm using blueimp server code <https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/tree/master/server/php>
- I've added that code in UI itself in my checkout for now, make sure in put in different /var/www/ path and access that via yeoman running from 3501 port. This will show ya CORS implementation of our upload
- IMPORTANT: 777 permission for files folder :P
